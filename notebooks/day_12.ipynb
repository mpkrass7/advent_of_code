    "<p>The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character <em>actions</em> paired with integer input <em>values</em>. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:</p>\n",

(That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is <code>N10</code>, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were <code>F</code>.)</p>\n",

    "<li><code>F7</code> would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>R90</code> would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face <em>south</em>; it remains at <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>\n",
